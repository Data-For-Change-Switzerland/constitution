## How we work
### How to operate ethically
While digital and data-driven technologies will have the potential to deliver significant benefit to people and society as a whole, we must approach the adoption of these promising technologies responsibly and in a way that is conducive to public trust. Our reputation for delivering safe and ethical data must be upheld as we seek to innovate.

Furthermore, increasing use of data-driven technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), could cause unintended harm if we do not think about issues such as transparency, accountability, safety, efficacy, explicability, fairness, equity and bias. For example, there is a risk that it could benefit some groups at the expense of others.

People need to know that their data is being used for their benefit and that their privacy and rights are safeguarded. Innovators are responsible for ensuring people are properly informed about how and when data about them is shared so that they may feel reassured that their data is being used for legally, fairly and equitably.

Our Data Ethics Framework is designed to inform and enable the development and adoption of safe, ethical and effective digital and data-driven technologies. It clearly sets out the behaviours we expect from those developing, deploying and using data-driven technologies, to ensure that everyone abides by the ethical principles for data initiatives developed by us. By that we focus mainly on the 4 principles below:
- respect for persons
- respect for human rights
- participation
- accounting for decision
